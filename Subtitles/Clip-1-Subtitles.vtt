00:00:00.275 --> 00:00:02.675 
The three other dangers, in addition to

2
00:00:02.675 --> 00:00:05.555 
inhalation, is laceration, which is

3
00:00:05.555 --> 00:00:08.195 
cuts, radiation, which is

4
00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:10.435 
infrared or an ultraviolet radiation from

5
00:00:10.435 --> 00:00:12.115
the furnaces when they're on, and

6
00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:13.795
incineration, where you light something

7
00:00:13.795 --> 00:00:16.275
on fire. Now incineration

8
00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:19.435
is typically lighting

9
00:00:19.435 --> 00:00:21.395
your clothes on fire, which does happen

10
00:00:21.395 --> 00:00:22.995
if you bump into a hot piece of glass.

11
00:00:23.315 --> 00:00:25.715
Now the good thing is you want to wear

12
00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:28.995
natural fibers. Wool and cotton

13
00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:31.395
have the nice tendency of burning without

14
00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:34.315
melting. If you wear polyester or you're

15
00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:36.675
really into rayon, you can shrink wrap

16
00:00:36.675 --> 00:00:38.835
yourself with your clothes, which is

17
00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:41.715
really unpleasant. So if

18
00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:44.595
you've got a choice, wear natural,

19
00:00:45.155 --> 00:00:47.235
fairly tight-fitting

20
00:00:49.075 --> 00:00:50.915
fibers. You don't want a bunch of baggy

21
00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:53.795
clothes that can snag on things. And

22
00:00:54.235 --> 00:00:55.915
what I have on is perfectly fine: A pair

23
00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:58.675
of blue jeans, a shirt

24
00:00:58.995 --> 00:01:00.915
and you don't have to tuck the shirt in,

25
00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:02.675
but just make sure that it's not going to

26
00:01:02.675 --> 00:01:05.035
hook onto anything. And then short

27
00:01:05.035 --> 00:01:06.915
sleeves are fine. You can also wear long

28
00:01:06.915 --> 00:01:08.115
sleeves. If you're working on a big

29
00:01:08.115 --> 00:01:10.235
piece, it's hot, you want that extra

30
00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:11.955
protection on your sleeves, that's great.

31
00:01:12.115 --> 00:01:14.515
Just try to wear cotton or wool because

32
00:01:14.515 --> 00:01:16.195
it's a lot safer and it's also more

33
00:01:16.195 --> 00:01:18.315
comfortable. The other thing you've got

34
00:01:18.315 --> 00:01:21.155
to be careful of is your shoes. A

35
00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:23.395
good pair of shoes is anything with a

36
00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:25.995
closed toe and a

37
00:01:26.595 --> 00:01:28.795
good heel. You don't want to slip on

38
00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:31.355
anything on the floor. The floor of a

39
00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:32.995
glass studio can get wet, it can get

40
00:01:32.995 --> 00:01:35.835
slick, and also little bits of glass will

41
00:01:35.835 --> 00:01:37.555
fall onto it. So you want something

42
00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:39.875
that's got a good sole on it, and work

43
00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:41.555
boots are great, tennis shoes are fine,

44
00:01:41.715 --> 00:01:44.035
but no sandals and no open-toed shoes,

45
00:01:44.275 --> 00:01:45.875
because glass falls on the floor and

46
00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:48.595
it'll get into your toes. The other

47
00:01:48.595 --> 00:01:50.355
thing is when you've finished

48
00:01:50.355 --> 00:01:51.955
glassblowing for the day, check the

49
00:01:51.955 --> 00:01:53.635
bottom of your shoes to make sure there's

50
00:01:53.635 --> 00:01:55.075
no little bits of glass that tend to

51
00:01:55.075 --> 00:01:56.915
embed themselves in the sole and then

52
00:01:56.915 --> 00:01:58.675
follow you home. One of the worst things

53
00:01:58.755 --> 00:02:01.115
is to get cut when you're at home after

54
00:02:01.115 --> 00:02:02.275
you've taken off your shoes because a

55
00:02:02.275 --> 00:02:03.875
little piece of glass found its way home

56
00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:06.275
with you. So just wear some shoes and be

57
00:02:06.275 --> 00:02:08.035
sure to wipe them or check them when you

58
00:02:08.035 --> 00:02:10.875
leave the studio. Okay, so the

59
00:02:10.915 --> 00:02:12.195
one piece of safety equipment that

60
00:02:12.195 --> 00:02:13.715
everyone thinks we should have that we

61
00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:16.555
don't is gloves. Gloves really aren't

62
00:02:16.555 --> 00:02:18.155
very good in a glass studio for a couple

63
00:02:18.235 --> 00:02:19.835
reasons. Number one, they tend to

64
00:02:19.835 --> 00:02:22.035
decrease your dexterity. So if you're

65
00:02:22.035 --> 00:02:23.155
trying to work a piece of glass and

66
00:02:23.155 --> 00:02:24.195
you've got a glove on, it's kind of

67
00:02:24.195 --> 00:02:25.715
clumsy, you can't move around, and the

68
00:02:25.715 --> 00:02:27.235
pipe tends to slip if you've got a glove

69
00:02:27.235 --> 00:02:29.875
on. The second problem is a safety

70
00:02:29.875 --> 00:02:32.515
problem. A glove will protect you from a

71
00:02:32.515 --> 00:02:35.315
burn instantly, but the problem is if you

72
00:02:35.315 --> 00:02:37.075
grab something with a glove, you won't

73
00:02:37.075 --> 00:02:38.635
know that it's hot. And because you don't

74
00:02:38.635 --> 00:02:40.555
know that it's hot, you'll keep holding

75
00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:42.835
onto it until the glove itself heats up.

76
00:02:43.035 --> 00:02:44.595
And by the time you realize that you've

77
00:02:44.595 --> 00:02:46.115
grabbed something that's hot, now you're

78
00:02:46.115 --> 00:02:48.515
holding it with a burning glove on your

79
00:02:48.515 --> 00:02:50.275
hand. So you'll actually get a worse burn

80
00:02:50.355 --> 00:02:52.035
if you have a glove on your hand. So we

81
00:02:52.035 --> 00:02:53.155
work barehanded.
