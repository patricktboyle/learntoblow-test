00:00:05.268 --> 00:00:06.628
So what happens if your punty is

00:00:06.628 --> 00:00:09.588
off-center, but the top of your

00:00:09.588 --> 00:00:12.548
piece is too

00:00:12.548 --> 00:00:14.268
hard to support with the tweezers? You can

00:00:14.268 --> 00:00:16.268
see right now, I've already heated up

00:00:16.268 --> 00:00:17.908
this lip, and I can't really grab it very

00:00:17.908 --> 00:00:19.428
well with the tweezers. Well, there's

00:00:19.428 --> 00:00:20.868
another technique called the wiggle,

00:00:21.428 --> 00:00:24.068
where you take your newspaper, or the

00:00:24.068 --> 00:00:26.308
carbon pad in this place, and you find

00:00:26.308 --> 00:00:28.828
the high spot, which is right there, and

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:31.188
support it a little bit, and just push it

00:00:31.188 --> 00:00:33.948
up. So we're just going to

00:00:35.108 --> 00:00:36.708
push the piece back on center,

00:00:39.428 --> 00:00:40.068
like that.

00:00:43.108 --> 00:00:44.268
Now the trick with this is you've got to

00:00:44.268 --> 00:00:45.748
keep the paper moving. If you stop the

00:00:45.748 --> 00:00:47.468
paper, it'll stick to the glass. But if

00:00:47.468 --> 00:00:49.028
you keep it moving, it's another way to

00:00:49.028 --> 00:00:50.788
grab it and sort of push that piece back

00:00:50.788 --> 00:00:51.348
on center.

00:00:54.708 --> 00:00:56.148
And we true it up a little bit with the

00:00:56.148 --> 00:00:56.548
jacks.
