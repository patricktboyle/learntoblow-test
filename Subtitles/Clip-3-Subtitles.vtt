Well, if you want to really get good at

00:00:04.388 --> 00:00:06.148
jacking and you want some extra practice,

00:00:06.308 --> 00:00:07.828
I've got a great exercise for you. It's

00:00:07.828 --> 00:00:10.388
called making an optic cup. And what

00:00:10.388 --> 00:00:13.028
we'll do is we'll make a regular bubble

00:00:13.268 --> 00:00:15.988
and then put three or four or even more

00:00:15.988 --> 00:00:18.548
sets of jack lines in, folding them in on

00:00:18.548 --> 00:00:20.308
each other. This is a great way to master

00:00:20.308 --> 00:00:22.348
control with the jacks, and it also makes

00:00:22.348 --> 00:00:25.348
kind of a neat cup. Okay,

00:00:25.348 --> 00:00:27.308
so to make an optic cup, you start with a

00:00:27.308 --> 00:00:29.548
cylinder that doesn't have any jack lines

00:00:29.548 --> 00:00:31.548
in it. So we've got a nice cylindrical

00:00:31.548 --> 00:00:33.788
bubble here. And what I want to do is

00:00:33.788 --> 00:00:36.148
choose a spot about two-thirds of the way

00:00:36.148 --> 00:00:37.988
down where I'm going to put my first

00:00:37.988 --> 00:00:40.388
ring. And what I like to do when I make

00:00:40.388 --> 00:00:42.708
these is draw my guidelines for my rings

00:00:43.148 --> 00:00:45.828
at the beginning. That way I know exactly

00:00:45.828 --> 00:00:47.988
where they're going to go at the end. So

00:00:47.988 --> 00:00:49.588
we'll put three rings in this one.

00:00:55.598 --> 00:00:58.238
And eventually I'm going to jack it here

00:00:58.238 --> 00:01:00.198
at the neck to break it off. So I'll draw

00:01:00.198 --> 00:01:01.838
a little guideline for that too.

00:01:21.388 --> 00:01:23.708
Okay, so let's get that first fold in

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:26.028
here. I go to my guideline,

00:01:27.948 --> 00:01:30.868
and I jack down maybe

00:01:30.868 --> 00:01:32.628
about half to three-quarters of an inch.

00:01:32.628 --> 00:01:35.108
And once that jack line is nice and

00:01:35.108 --> 00:01:37.788
sharp, I collapse the glass

00:01:38.188 --> 00:01:40.948
in on itself. And when the glass touches,

00:01:40.948 --> 00:01:42.788
it's going to make a nice fold.

00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:48.788
The next step is to heat it

00:01:52.388 --> 00:01:53.428
and stretch it out a little bit.

00:01:58.148 --> 00:01:59.948
Okay, time for that second fold.

00:02:10.538 --> 00:02:12.298
Now I'm stretching it out a little bit as

00:02:13.658 --> 00:02:15.938
I jack it. It gives me a little bit of

00:02:15.938 --> 00:02:18.498
extra separation. And it's

00:02:18.498 --> 00:02:20.298
important not to push too hard or you'll

00:02:20.298 --> 00:02:21.908
collapse the folds on top of each

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:23.348
other, and you want them separate,

00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:25.908
so there's #2.

00:03:11.448 --> 00:03:12.328
And fold three.

00:03:14.808 --> 00:03:16.408
Okay, for the final step of the optic

00:03:16.408 --> 00:03:18.648
cup, I'm going to inflate it with the

00:03:18.728 --> 00:03:20.448
help of my partner. Okay, please blow.

00:03:28.218 --> 00:03:30.138
And while she's doing that, I can set in

00:03:30.138 --> 00:03:32.938
the final jack line. This is where I'm

00:03:32.938 --> 00:03:34.538
actually going to break the piece off.

00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:43.728
Stop, thank you.

00:03:58.278 --> 00:03:58.838
Blow, please.

00:04:08.888 --> 00:04:09.928
Stop. Thank you.

00:04:15.368 --> 00:04:17.968
So, a three-ring optic cup. All we have to

00:04:17.968 --> 00:04:20.568
do is punty that bottom, open that top,

00:04:20.648 --> 00:04:21.208
and it's done.
