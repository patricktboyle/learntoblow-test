WEBVTT

00:00:00.187 --> 00:00:01.627
we haven't introduced the marver yet, but

00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:04.507
the marver is a steel table, and it was

00:00:04.507 --> 00:00:06.787
originally made of marble, and they're

00:00:06.787 --> 00:00:08.427
now made of steel, and it's a very, very

00:00:08.427 --> 00:00:10.427
powerful tool. But it's also very

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:12.787
difficult to use because the marver

00:00:12.787 --> 00:00:14.747
requires very good pipe control. It

00:00:14.827 --> 00:00:16.987
requires you to maintain the pipe at a

00:00:16.987 --> 00:00:19.067
constant level and to be able to roll the

00:00:19.067 --> 00:00:21.147
pipe very smoothly. If you're able to do

00:00:21.147 --> 00:00:22.187
that, you're going to be able to do some

00:00:22.387 --> 00:00:25.267
fantastic stuff to fix pieces and shape

00:00:25.267 --> 00:00:28.027
pieces using the marver. So let's

00:00:28.027 --> 00:00:30.507
begin with your basic pipe rolling,

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:32.427
and we're going to bring it over to a

00:00:32.427 --> 00:00:35.387
marvering exercise. Now, again, body

00:00:35.387 --> 00:00:37.067
position is very important. A lot of

00:00:37.067 --> 00:00:38.907
people, when they're beginning to blow

00:00:38.907 --> 00:00:40.987
glass, will marver like this. They'll

00:00:40.987 --> 00:00:43.067
stay away from the glass, and again, I

00:00:43.067 --> 00:00:45.027
think it's mostly because they tend to be

00:00:45.027 --> 00:00:47.947
afraid of the glass. You need to do

00:00:48.427 --> 00:00:50.027
exactly the opposite when you're

00:00:50.027 --> 00:00:52.507
marvering. You want to have this right

00:00:52.507 --> 00:00:55.227
hand forward, this left hand forward, and

00:00:55.227 --> 00:00:57.467
you want to get as close to the front of

00:00:57.547 --> 00:00:59.347
the piece as you can. As a matter of

00:00:59.347 --> 00:01:01.227
fact, you should slide that left hand

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.547
forward as far as you can once you're

00:01:03.547 --> 00:01:06.187
working with a hot pipe. Now, this may

00:01:06.187 --> 00:01:07.587
require cooling the pipe. We'll get to

00:01:07.587 --> 00:01:09.867
that later. But for the sake of this

00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:12.027
exercise, let's pretend the pipe is cool

00:01:12.187 --> 00:01:14.627
right to about the two-foot point. So put

00:01:14.627 --> 00:01:16.507
your left hand at that two-foot mark, and

00:01:16.507 --> 00:01:17.627
put your right hand wherever it's

00:01:17.627 --> 00:01:19.267
comfortable. Now you're going to come to

00:01:19.267 --> 00:01:21.227
the marver, and you're going to stand

00:01:21.227 --> 00:01:23.307
close to the marver and slide your hands

00:01:23.307 --> 00:01:26.107
back so that you can see what's going on.

00:01:26.267 --> 00:01:28.387
You want to get your face right over

00:01:28.387 --> 00:01:30.987
where that hot glass is going to be. So

00:01:30.987 --> 00:01:33.027
instead of standing like this, you're

00:01:33.027 --> 00:01:35.347
going to stand like that. So standing at

00:01:35.347 --> 00:01:38.107
the marver, you're going to rotate the

00:01:38.107 --> 00:01:41.067
pipe smoothly

00:01:42.507 --> 00:01:44.267
over the end of the whole marver. And you

00:01:44.267 --> 00:01:47.147
can hear my old blowpipe there making a

00:01:47.147 --> 00:01:50.147
bunch of noise. And it's okay to lean out

00:01:50.147 --> 00:01:50.747
a little bit.

00:01:53.227 --> 00:01:54.667
Sometimes it's good to keep your feet

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:57.067
still if you want to move smoothly.

00:02:03.987 --> 00:02:06.507
And that's it. Back and forth across the

00:02:06.507 --> 00:02:09.067
marver. If you can move back and forth

00:02:09.067 --> 00:02:11.147
across the marver at about the speed that

00:02:11.147 --> 00:02:13.547
I was doing, smoothly without stopping,

00:02:13.787 --> 00:02:16.347
you're fine. Now, faster is not

00:02:16.347 --> 00:02:17.867
necessarily better. If you can go like

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:20.427
that,not going to do any good, because

00:02:20.587 --> 00:02:22.507
the glass isn't going to require that

00:02:22.507 --> 00:02:24.747
much speed. But if you're slow, if you

00:02:24.747 --> 00:02:27.507
can only move like this, that may be a

00:02:27.507 --> 00:02:30.187
little bit too slow. And the point is, as

00:02:30.187 --> 00:02:32.267
you're doing this first exercise, work

00:02:32.267 --> 00:02:34.027
both hands. Now, it's fairly easy to

00:02:34.027 --> 00:02:35.467
cheat on this first exercise and just

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:37.467
sort of go like that with your

00:02:37.467 --> 00:02:39.387
fingertips. But that's why we've got the

00:02:39.387 --> 00:02:40.987
second exercise, because once you've

00:02:40.987 --> 00:02:42.907
mastered that first exercise, back and

00:02:42.907 --> 00:02:44.987
forth on the marver with the pipe being

00:02:44.987 --> 00:02:47.547
supported by the marver,It's time for the

00:02:47.547 --> 00:02:48.907
second exercise, which is the real

00:02:48.907 --> 00:02:50.507
marvering exercise. The real marvering

00:02:50.507 --> 00:02:52.587
exercise involves supporting the pipe,

00:02:52.867 --> 00:02:54.587
and you're going to do this by putting

00:02:54.587 --> 00:02:56.267
that left hand forward, having that right

00:02:56.267 --> 00:02:58.987
hand over the back, and holding the pipe

00:02:58.987 --> 00:03:01.947
level at about four inches above

00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:04.267
the marver. You want to now roll the

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:07.147
pipe, and simulate rolling a piece of

00:03:07.147 --> 00:03:09.627
glass as you move smoothly

00:03:10.027 --> 00:03:11.147
across the marver.

00:03:15.547 --> 00:03:18.187
Get to the end, stop, rotate the other

00:03:18.187 --> 00:03:20.747
direction, all the way back.

00:03:21.827 --> 00:03:23.587
And you'll notice, as I do this, my pipe

00:03:23.587 --> 00:03:24.827
goes up and down a little bit. That's

00:03:24.827 --> 00:03:27.627
okay. It's not going to be perfect.

00:03:29.267 --> 00:03:31.147
But what you want to do is do it without

00:03:31.147 --> 00:03:33.067
stopping. So in other words, you don't

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:34.587
want to do this,

00:03:35.907 --> 00:03:38.907
where you stop the pipe

00:03:39.787 --> 00:03:42.507
turning. So hopefully those

00:03:42.507 --> 00:03:43.987
pipe rolling skills are already getting

00:03:43.987 --> 00:03:45.347
down into your hands, and you can start

00:03:45.347 --> 00:03:46.747
rotating the pipe automatically.

00:03:48.507 --> 00:03:50.267
So those are the two basic marvering

00:03:50.267 --> 00:03:52.947
exercises. Now as you're doing those, you

00:03:52.947 --> 00:03:55.067
want to do them in three orientations.

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:57.707
The first one is down. So

00:03:58.667 --> 00:04:01.467
You put this right hand down, left

00:04:01.467 --> 00:04:03.947
hand up, you're going to roll like that.

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:05.707
This simulates

00:04:07.307 --> 00:04:10.307
rolling a first gather off the pipe.

00:04:11.347 --> 00:04:13.387
And that's a fairly important move. I'm

00:04:13.387 --> 00:04:15.067
sort of bumping into my bench here.

00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:17.067
Normally, I keep the marver a little bit

00:04:17.067 --> 00:04:19.867
farther forward. The second motion is

00:04:19.867 --> 00:04:22.507
that one we just did. Smoothly

00:04:22.507 --> 00:04:24.467
level, back and forth.

00:04:29.187 --> 00:04:31.707
And the third motion is up at an angle,

00:04:31.707 --> 00:04:34.507
about a 45-degree angle, to pretend that

00:04:34.507 --> 00:04:35.947
you're marvering the tip of a piece of

00:04:35.947 --> 00:04:36.427
glass.

00:04:43.927 --> 00:04:46.887
Now, everyone feels silly doing these

00:04:46.887 --> 00:04:48.567
exercises. I know it's going to feel

00:04:48.567 --> 00:04:50.687
silly to go into a glass studio, grab a

00:04:50.687 --> 00:04:53.087
cold pipe, walk up to a marver, and, you

00:04:53.087 --> 00:04:55.087
know, have your imaginary glass and your

00:04:55.087 --> 00:04:57.447
imaginary friends watching you making

00:04:57.687 --> 00:05:00.387
nothing. It's very important, though,

00:05:00.387 --> 00:05:02.667
that you do these exercises, because once

00:05:02.667 --> 00:05:04.627
you do them, and you learn how to rotate

00:05:04.627 --> 00:05:07.147
that pipe automatically, you can do that

00:05:07.147 --> 00:05:08.747
automatically once you've got the glass

00:05:08.787 --> 00:05:10.507
on. And that's the most important thing.

00:05:10.667 --> 00:05:12.587
Once you get the glass on, the glass is

00:05:12.587 --> 00:05:13.867
going to distract you from everything

00:05:13.867 --> 00:05:14.867
else that you've been doing with the

00:05:14.867 --> 00:05:17.787
marver. The final thing you want to work

00:05:17.787 --> 00:05:20.307
on in this exercise is an active and

00:05:20.307 --> 00:05:23.067
passive left hand. What do I mean by

00:05:23.067 --> 00:05:25.467
active? If I'm turning the pipe with both

00:05:25.467 --> 00:05:27.947
hands, I have an active left hand, so I

00:05:27.947 --> 00:05:30.867
will be turning with both hands. So you

00:05:30.867 --> 00:05:32.747
watch my left hand. My left hand's

00:05:32.747 --> 00:05:34.107
actually supplying some power there. You

00:05:34.107 --> 00:05:36.027
can see the fingers moving. And then the

00:05:36.027 --> 00:05:38.507
other direction, I sort of cup it and

00:05:38.507 --> 00:05:39.347
move it like that. Now,

00:05:41.627 --> 00:05:43.747
that's a fine way to marver. If you have

00:05:43.747 --> 00:05:45.867
to use your left hand in an active

00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:48.267
manner, that's great. Now, once you get

00:05:48.267 --> 00:05:51.067
really good, you will be able to marver

00:05:51.787 --> 00:05:53.467
with a passive left hand. So you use your

00:05:53.467 --> 00:05:56.027
left hand just as a yoke, and I'm going to

00:05:56.027 --> 00:05:57.947
sort of exaggerate it here. But I'm

00:05:57.947 --> 00:06:00.147
turning the pipe continuously with just

00:06:00.147 --> 00:06:02.987
my right hand. Notice how much smoother

00:06:02.987 --> 00:06:05.707
that motion is. Because my left hand

00:06:05.707 --> 00:06:08.227
isn't moving, it's not making the pipe

00:06:08.227 --> 00:06:09.427
bounce up and down. So if I want to

00:06:09.427 --> 00:06:11.787
really marver a piece smoothly, I will

00:06:11.787 --> 00:06:14.667
use my left hand not to turn the

00:06:14.667 --> 00:06:17.147
pipe, but just to support it. And that

00:06:17.147 --> 00:06:19.307
motion, then, is much smoother because

00:06:19.787 --> 00:06:22.387
all the rotation is coming from here, and

00:06:22.387 --> 00:06:23.747
my height adjustment is coming from the

00:06:23.747 --> 00:06:26.667
left hand. So the final step

00:06:26.987 --> 00:06:29.827
is to do both exercises with

00:06:30.227 --> 00:06:32.187
an active and a passive left hand.

00:06:33.307 --> 00:06:33.867
And you're done.
