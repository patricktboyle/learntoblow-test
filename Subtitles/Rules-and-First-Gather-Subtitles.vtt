00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:04.910
Okay, let's review. There are seven steps

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.070
to the perfect gather. First,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.030
take the pipe and rotate it against the

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.470
wall. And while you're doing this, get

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.470
that hand back. Second, look for

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.390
the reflection of the pipe against the

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.630
surface of the glass. Third,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.350
touch the reflection to the pipe and hold

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.270
those hands still. Fourth,

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.230
make two complete rotations. Now, you can

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.670
make more than two, but you've got to

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:33.070
make at least two. The first rotation

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.910
gets the glass on the pipe. The second

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.790
rotation evens it out, so make two full

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.070
rotations. I've probably made about seven

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.590
there. Step

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.230
five, lift the pipe up past level,

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.870
break that strand off. Step

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.190
six, come on out.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.590
Now, technically, you've made a gather,

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.190
but you're not done yet, because step

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.310
seven is very important. The glass is

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.110
going to want to flow back onto the pipe,

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.630
but you can't do anything with glass

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.750
that's on the pipe, so you need to adjust

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.990
the glass. And usually this means holding

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.510
the glass forward a little bit, letting

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.390
the angle of the pipe let gravity pull

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.830
that glass off. Now, obviously, you've

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:11.870
got to be careful because you've got

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.390
screaming hot glass. You don't want to

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.710
just hold it like this, it'll run onto

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.310
your shoes. But just a little bit of

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.870
downward angle will let that glass

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.190
flow to the end and make your life a lot

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:23.790
easier when you've got to start shaping

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.630
it. Okay, let's do this with a real

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.110
furnace.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.990
Okay, so we're ready to make our first

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.230
gather. Now, I'm going to do this on a

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.910
blowpipe. You're probably going to make

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.910
your first gather with a punty, but it's

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:39.870
the same principle. Here we go. Jennifer

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.030
opens the door. I set the pipe on the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.470
sill and roll it up against the side of

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.950
the tank. Now I look in for the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.590
reflection on the surface. There's the

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.510
reflection. I touch the reflection to the

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.790
end of the blowpipe, make two full

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.270
rotations, come up

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.310
past level to break the strand, slide my

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.270
left hand forward, come out, and now

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.230
I hold the glass down and adjust it,

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.710
get that glass to flow off the end. That

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.830
looks pretty good. And there's a perfect

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.390
first gather.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.470
Let's take another look at a first gather

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.710
from the perspective of the person

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.870
blowing the glass. So you open the door,

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.510
set the pipe on the sill, and start

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.630
rotating against that right wall. Now

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.910
we're looking for the reflection of the

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.350
pipe on the surface of the glass. There's

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.230
the reflection. Touch the reflection to

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.230
the pipe and turn twice. Once you've

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.670
got the glass on the end, bring it up

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.710
past level, break the strand off, and

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.110
come out.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.790
And that's what a good first gather

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.430
should look like.
