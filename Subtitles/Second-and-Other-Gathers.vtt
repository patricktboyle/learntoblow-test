00:00:00.715 --> 00:00:03.595
Okay, we've just made our first gather,

00:00:03.595 --> 00:00:05.115
and it's time to make the second gather.

00:00:05.195 --> 00:00:06.115
But there are a couple of things to

00:00:06.115 --> 00:00:07.835
consider before you go into a tank for a

00:00:07.835 --> 00:00:10.475
second time, most of which concern the

00:00:10.475 --> 00:00:11.595
support that you're going to get from

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:13.315
that first bubble you made. Now, if you

00:00:13.315 --> 00:00:15.635
blew your glass out very, very thin, that

00:00:15.635 --> 00:00:17.715
glass is going to heat up very fast when

00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:19.315
you put that second gather of glass on

00:00:19.315 --> 00:00:20.875
it, and it's going to want to collapse.

00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:23.825
But if the bubble is too thick, it's

00:00:23.825 --> 00:00:25.625
going to be very cold, and it's probably

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:27.705
not going to heat evenly, and the second

00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:30.025
gather is going to blow out unevenly. So

00:00:30.265 --> 00:00:32.185
you need to strike a balance between

00:00:32.425 --> 00:00:34.665
temperature and thickness. And in

00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:36.585
general, I like to blow a first gather

00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:38.905
out so the bubble's about an inch, maybe

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:41.105
an inch and a quarter in diameter, and

00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:42.905
the piece has lost most of its glow,

00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:45.425
which it's almost done here. So I'm going

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:47.145
to wait another couple of seconds before

00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:49.385
I get that second gather. Now, to make a

00:00:49.385 --> 00:00:51.305
second gather, you do it just like the

00:00:51.305 --> 00:00:53.065
first, except you won't have as much

00:00:53.065 --> 00:00:54.825
trouble seeing the glass this time. You

00:00:54.825 --> 00:00:55.785
should know where it is by now.

00:01:03.065 --> 00:01:04.425
So here we go with the actual second

00:01:04.425 --> 00:01:06.505
gather itself. I've got the first gather

00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:08.025
nice and cool on the end of the blowpipe,

00:01:08.305 --> 00:01:10.105
and as I go into the tank, as always, I'm

00:01:10.105 --> 00:01:11.745
going to keep that pipe rotating so it

00:01:11.745 --> 00:01:13.305
doesn't stick to the wall or sill of the

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:15.785
tank. Rest it on the sill, rotate it up

00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:17.625
against that white wall, and dip it into

00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:18.945
the glass. Now it's easier to find the

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:20.505
glass, this time because I know where it

00:01:20.505 --> 00:01:22.425
is. Line up those moiles,

00:01:23.545 --> 00:01:26.065
push a little bit forward to gather glass

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:28.745
onto the tip, and break the strand off.

00:01:29.865 --> 00:01:31.785
Notice how slowly I'm turning the pipe,

00:01:31.945 --> 00:01:33.385
just at the rate that the glass wants to

00:01:33.385 --> 00:01:35.865
fall. And there's the second gather.

00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:45.975
A push gather is useful if you're trying

00:01:45.975 --> 00:01:47.615
to maximize the amount of glass you get

00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:49.455
out of the furnace in one shot. Notice

00:01:49.455 --> 00:01:51.135
I'm holding the pipe up at a high angle.

00:01:51.775 --> 00:01:54.185
So to do a push, you start like a regular

00:01:54.185 --> 00:01:56.265
gather and push into the glass, sort of

00:01:56.265 --> 00:01:57.785
shoveling it onto the end as you turn

00:01:57.785 --> 00:01:58.585
very fast.

00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:02.225
Now it's a little hard to balance, so you

00:02:02.225 --> 00:02:03.705
may want to let some of that glass run

00:02:03.705 --> 00:02:05.225
back onto the moile for stability.

00:02:07.385 --> 00:02:08.825
And that's what a push gather looks like.

00:02:08.825 --> 00:02:10.185
You get about one and a half times as

00:02:10.185 --> 00:02:11.545
much glass as you normally would.

00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:18.865
A pull gather is sort of the opposite of

00:02:18.865 --> 00:02:20.745
a push gather. You use this when you want

00:02:20.745 --> 00:02:22.505
only a very small amount of glass on the

00:02:22.505 --> 00:02:25.105
pipe. Now ideally, you put the pipe in at

00:02:25.105 --> 00:02:26.785
a very high angle, but if I do that in

00:02:26.785 --> 00:02:27.905
this photo, you won't be able to see

00:02:27.905 --> 00:02:29.905
what's going on. So I'm going to use a

00:02:29.905 --> 00:02:31.145
little bit lower angle than you would

00:02:31.145 --> 00:02:34.025
normally use. It begins the same, you get

00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:35.225
the glass on the end of the pipe, and

00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:37.065
instead of pushing or remaining still,

00:02:37.225 --> 00:02:39.145
you pull back and hold the pipe down.

00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:41.305
That allows the extra glass to fall off

00:02:41.305 --> 00:02:43.665
the end, and then you come up level to

00:02:43.665 --> 00:02:44.505
break the strand.

00:02:49.705 --> 00:02:50.865
And that's the amount of glass you get

00:02:50.865 --> 00:02:52.905
from a pull gather, about half as much as

00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:53.705
a normal gather.

00:03:01.825 --> 00:03:04.745
A double dip or double gather is a way of

00:03:04.745 --> 00:03:06.985
getting the maximum amount of glass out

00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:09.145
on the first gather. Now this only works

00:03:09.145 --> 00:03:10.385
on a first gather. What you're going to

00:03:10.385 --> 00:03:12.265
do is basically put two gathers on top of

00:03:12.265 --> 00:03:15.185
each other right in a row. So we begin by

00:03:15.185 --> 00:03:16.745
making a normal first gather. This is

00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:18.745
just a standard first gather, maybe

00:03:18.745 --> 00:03:20.665
pushing a little bit forward to get a

00:03:20.665 --> 00:03:22.465
little bit more glass. And then I'm just

00:03:22.465 --> 00:03:23.945
going to come out here for just a second

00:03:23.945 --> 00:03:25.865
and let that glass cool. Now it's not

00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:27.305
cooling very much because as you can see

00:03:27.305 --> 00:03:29.025
it's still in the furnace. You can let

00:03:29.025 --> 00:03:30.345
this cool outside the furnace, but I'm

00:03:30.345 --> 00:03:32.505
just going to keep it on camera here. And

00:03:32.505 --> 00:03:34.505
after a couple of seconds, it chills up,

00:03:34.585 --> 00:03:36.905
and I can go in for a second layer, and I

00:03:36.905 --> 00:03:38.545
align those moiles on that second layer

00:03:38.545 --> 00:03:40.345
and push a little bit on that second

00:03:40.345 --> 00:03:42.345
layer as it's going on, break off the

00:03:42.345 --> 00:03:45.065
strand, and now I've retrieved basically

00:03:45.065 --> 00:03:46.625
double the amount of glass that I would

00:03:46.625 --> 00:03:48.465
normally get on a gather. You can also

00:03:48.465 --> 00:03:49.625
see I get a couple of bubbles.
